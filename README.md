# Project Description

This project uses the Spring Framework to define date/time formatters and printers. The DateTimePrinter, DatePrinter, and TimePrinter classes are used to print dates/times in different formats.
The DateConfig, DateTimeConfig, and TimeConfig classes provide the project's configuration and create the date/time formatters.

## Using the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is a popular framework for Java applications. In this project, we use the Spring Framework to define and configure our date/time formatters and printers.

### Components

The `@Component` annotation is used to mark classes as Spring components. Spring components are automatically detected and registered in the Spring application context. 
In this project, the `DateTimePrinter`, `DatePrinter`, and `TimePrinter` classes are marked as components.

### Beans

Beans are objects managed by the Spring Framework. In this project, we define beans for our date/time formatters and other objects.
Beans are created using the `@Bean` annotation, and their names can be specified using the "name" parameter. For example, in the `DateConfig` class, we create a bean for the `DateTimeFormatter` using the name "dateFormatter".

### Configuration

Configuration classes provide the necessary configuration for our Spring application. In this project, we use the `@Configuration` annotation to mark our configuration classes.
Configuration classes contain bean definitions and other configuration elements.

### Using the Components and Beans

Once our components and beans are defined, we can use them in our application. 
In this project, we use the `DateTimePrinter`, `DatePrinter`, and `TimePrinter` classes to print dates/times in different formats.

### Conclusion

The Spring Framework provides a powerful and flexible way to manage components, beans, and configuration in Java applications. 
In this project, we have seen how to use the Spring Framework to define and use date/time formatters and printers.
